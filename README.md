# Angular Forms 
This application demonstrates the usage forms in Angular. 
The goals is to have a highly reusable form setup that can be duplicated with minimal changes.


# Experimental / unconventional elements of this project: 
- using a const to store all error messages (see further on)
- Using single file components
- Libs has a form helper to handle form validation setup. See comments in file
- formState as a single object. Traditionally multiple variables would be used or state management


## Future optimizations & considerations:

#### Form
- Depending on the use case, a 'confirm password' field could be added.
- Password currently requires the usage of lowercase and uppercase letters and at least 8 characters. 
- These requirements could have been made more explicit to the user pre-interaction.
- Currently they only show up as an error message.
- Password validation has a separate minLength(8) and A-Za-z regex.
 Current approach makes the code a bit more readable, but more verbose. 
 This could be combined into one if individual errors are less important:
 ```javascript
 regex = ‚Äò^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z]).{8,}$'; )
 ```

#### Custom password validator üêî or ü•ö: 
When using the passwordValidator to match first- or last name on the password field, 
the error doesn't go away after the name field has been updated. 
Alternatively it could be used on the global form, but it would not highlight 
the individual password field as the error source. 

This could in turn be solved by tracking individual field values. 
Because the form is used from top to bottom, and the user wouldn't change its name 
for the sake of the password, this approach has been chosen. 


#### Validation Messages
Validation messages have been placed in a language file. 
Angular i18n is not being used for a few reasons:
- there's no need to support multiple languages
- one less service is needed 
- language.json is not exposed through an API call showcasing the whole application


#### Error handling 
A global error handler could be implemented to handle all errors that have been uncaught. 
This includes error responses from the server and also network / connection errors.
Services could also have individual error handling, that has not been implemented at this time.


#### Confirmation page
Currently a message is displayed in the template if the user successfully submits the form. 
This part could be made a separate component for reusability, or in a larger application 
that includes routing the user would be redirected to the success page. 


#### E-mail address validation:
- This example uses built in validation which provides syntax check https://angular.io/api/forms/EmailValidator
- DNS lookup could be used to see if domain.com even exists
- SMTP verification could check if email address actually exists,
  but this isn't always supported by the server / provider and does not work on catch-all's
- Those checks could be done with an Async Validator (https://angular.io/api/forms/AsyncValidator)

Best way to verify the e-mail address is to send a verification e-mail with a BIG Confirm button.

- All of the above is actually assuming that the e-mail address isn't registered already. In that case you might:
  - redirect the user to the login form
  - autofill the forgot password form
  - don't make it too easy for malicious users to check if e-mail address exists
  - limit the amount of check requests to prevent potential abuse
  - do we still like captcha's / I'm not a robot ?
